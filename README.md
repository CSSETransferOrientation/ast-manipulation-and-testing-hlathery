## Completion Amount

The subtasks that work are arith_id, mult_id, and combined(so it seems). The unit test was implemented and correctly works, however it only currently takes in the tests from the previous 3 mentioned tests. As I don't have any tests set up for the other ones.

## Things I Learned

Not only did this give me a very good feel of how classes work in python, as I've only ever created my classes in Java. So it took me awhile at the start to read through all the default implemented class code and understand how everything was working.

I think it also gave me a very good feel of how I should go about thinking about the steps and possible cases of a program. As this was a very _visual_ type program to me. I found myself understanding the problem and how to code it as I was working down the tree on a whiteboard. And all of the possibilities of where numbers/zeros/operators could be and the outcomes of those things which I had to make new `if:`'s for.

I think the best thing I can take away from this assignment too is the use of the debugger. Things that I was stuck on for an hour plus were realized in a few minutes when I looked at what was happening under the hood.

## Critiques

I think the only thing that I really didn't enjoy doing was the testbench. I found myself really enjoying learning how the class worked, and then implementing the identities. However the testbench just felt very irrating to deal with and I didn't exactly understand to much of what I was doing, I was just trying to run parallel to what we had done in class with the recursionIO.
